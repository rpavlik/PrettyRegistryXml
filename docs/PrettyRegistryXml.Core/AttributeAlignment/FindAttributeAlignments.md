# AttributeAlignment.FindAttributeAlignments method

Compute an array of AttributeAlignment for a collection of elements.

```csharp
public static AttributeAlignment[] FindAttributeAlignments(IEnumerable<XElement> elements, 
    IDictionary<string, int>? extraWidth = null)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| elements | A collection of elements |
| extraWidth | Optional dictionary of attribute name to additional width |

## Return Value

Array of alignments

## Remarks

The element with the most attributes is used to extract the attributes to align and their order. The align width for each of those attributes is the maximum length of that attribute's value across all elements, except for the last attribute, which gets set as "do not align" if it is not mentioned in *extraWidth*. This prevents a lot of space before the end of the tag. Any other attributes mentioned in other elements are added to the end of the list as "do not align", so the resulting list contains every attribute name in the entire collection of elements.
